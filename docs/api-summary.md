# API Summary - Simplified Design

## Overview
The Job Scheduler API has been simplified to focus on core functionality while maintaining all essential features.

## Removed Endpoints
The following endpoints were removed to simplify the API design:

1. **`POST /jobs/{id}/activate`** - Removed
   - **Reason**: Job reactivation can be done through the `PATCH /jobs/{id}` endpoint by setting `isActive: true`
   - **Alternative**: Use `PATCH /jobs/{id}` with `{"isActive": true}`

2. **`GET /executions`** - Removed
   - **Reason**: Fetching all executions across all jobs is not a common use case
   - **Alternative**: Use `GET /jobs/{id}/history` for job-specific execution history

3. **`GET /executions/{id}`** - Removed
   - **Reason**: Individual execution details are available through job history
   - **Alternative**: Use `GET /jobs/{id}/history` to get execution details

## Final API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
```
GET    /health                    - Health check
POST   /jobs                      - Create job
GET    /jobs                      - List jobs
GET    /jobs/{id}                 - Get job
PATCH  /jobs/{id}                 - Update job (including reactivation)
DELETE /jobs/{id}                 - Soft delete job
GET    /jobs/{id}/schedule        - Get job schedule
GET    /jobs/{id}/history         - Get job execution history
```

### Key Benefits of Simplified Design

1. **Cleaner API**: Fewer endpoints to maintain and document
2. **Consistent Patterns**: All job operations under `/jobs` path
3. **Flexible Updates**: Single update endpoint handles all job modifications
4. **Focused Functionality**: Each endpoint has a clear, single purpose
5. **Better Performance**: No unnecessary bulk operations

### Job Reactivation
To reactivate a soft-deleted job, use the update endpoint:
```bash
PATCH /jobs/{id}
{
  "isActive": true
}
```

### Execution History
All execution-related queries are job-specific:
```bash
GET /jobs/{id}/history?limit=10&status=FAILED
```

## Implementation Notes

- All endpoints maintain the same authentication and error handling
- Response formats remain consistent
- Database schema unchanged
- Storage layer updated to remove unused methods
- Testing scripts updated to reflect simplified API

This simplified design reduces complexity while maintaining all essential functionality for a production job scheduler.
